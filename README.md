[REPORT](https://github.com/gouravdangi/rocket-cost-prediction/blob/25a77f821482237ce0bde2a855c8be6c5e9c17d2/ds-capstone-template-coursera%202.pdf)

Here we predicted if the falcon 9 first stage will land successfully as SpaceX advertise Falcon 9  to be reusable rocket, hence this affects the price of launch.

If we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.


In this capstone, I take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. My job is to determine the price of each launch. I have to do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
